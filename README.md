### A Bilingual Weather App

## Objective
To build a React app using a weather API and returning results in English and in Spanish. 

## Motivation
I wanted to build a bilingual app to keep up my Spanish language skills and show change of state in a single page React app.

## Minimum Viable Product
- AAU I should be able to search for a city in English or Spanish and see weather results in either language.
- AAU I should see the current time in the proper format for that language.
